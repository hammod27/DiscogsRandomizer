# DiscogsRandomizer

This is a project I've been working on in my free time. 

The point of Discogs Randomizer is to randomize your albums that you have on Discogs to pick what album you are going to listen to.
I know what you're saying, 'Discogs already has a random feature!' and you're not wrong. However, with this script you
can input multiple Discogs accounts to randomize multiple peoples' albums. This can be beneficial if you want to pick an
album to listen to with a buddy if you both have your records on Discogs.com. Another feature that was added is a New album
feature. This allows you to randomize the most recent albums that you have put into your collection. You can pick how many,
ie: you can randomize the 17 most recent albums if you'd like.

I mostly made this for myself, but use it if you'd like. It's not terribly user friendly at the moment.
